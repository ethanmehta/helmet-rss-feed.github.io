Albert Levitt (1887â€“1968) was an American attorney and official who ran for office many times, receiving only a small percentage of the vote. He attended Harvard Law School, and helped draft the Equal Rights Amendment. After serving as a law professor, he settled in Connecticut with his first wife, the suffragist Elsie Hill, and involved himself in politics. The faction he led affected the outcome in multiple races. In 1933, he was given a position in the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration. While a judge in the Virgin Islands in 1935, he ordered that women there must be allowed to register and vote. After leaving government work in 1937, Levitt challenged the appointment of Hugo Black to the Supreme Court; in its decision, Ex parte Levitt, the court refused to consider his claims. He moved to California, and began to run as a fringe candidate in Republican primaries, including in the 1950 Senate election, finishing sixth out of six, behind the winner, Richard Nixon.
